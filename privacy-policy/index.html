      <h3>2.1. Non-Personal Information (e.g., Analytics)</h3>
      <p>We may use third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand how the Website is used and to improve its content and functionality. These services collect non-personally identifiable information such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address (anonymized)</li>

        <li>Time spent on pages</li>

      </ul>
      <p>This data is aggregated and used for statistical purposes to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement around the site, and gather demographic information.</p>

      <h3>2.2. Directly Provided Information</h3>
      <p>Currently, this Website does not feature forms for direct submission of personal data (e.g., contact forms, comment sections, registration). If we introduce such features in the future, we will update this policy to specify what data is collected and how it is used.</p>

      <h2>3. How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>The non-personal information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To improve the content and structure of the Website.</li>
        <li>To understand user engagement and optimize the user experience.</li>
        <li>To diagnose technical problems and maintain the Website's security.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
      <p>Our Website may use "cookies" to enhance user experience. Cookies are small files placed on your device by a website that you visit. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>**Analytics Cookies:** If we use analytics services (like Google Analytics), they may place cookies on your device to track your usage patterns on the Website. These cookies do not collect personal information that identifies you.</li>
        <li>**Essential Cookies:** Some cookies may be necessary for the basic functioning of the website (e.g., for managing sessions, if any dynamic content were introduced).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>Our Website contains links to other websites of interest (e.g., LinkedIn profiles, external articles, company websites). However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website.

You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.</p>

In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Since we primarily collect non-personally identifiable, aggregated data and do not typically store direct personal information, individual data access or deletion requests as per GDPR or other regulations are generally not applicable to browsing activity.
